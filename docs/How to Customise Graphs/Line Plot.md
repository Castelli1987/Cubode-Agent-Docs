## Introduction

Line plots are a powerful tool for visualizing data trends over time or across categories. They are particularly useful when you need to compare changes in data points, display trends, or analyze patterns. One of the key advantages of line plots is the ability to create multiple plots from the same dataset, allowing for direct comparison between different data series.

This document provides an in-depth look at line plots, their features, customization options, and how you can generate them using Cubode-Agent.

## What is a Line Plot?

A **Line Plot** is a type of chart that displays information as a series of data points connected by straight line segments. It is commonly used to visualize trends, patterns, or relationships between variables over a continuous interval or time period.

### Key Characteristics:
- **Continuous Data**: Line plots are ideal for displaying data that changes continuously over time or categories.
- **Trends and Patterns**: They effectively show trends, helping to identify increases, decreases, cycles, or other patterns in data.
- **Multiple Series**: Line plots can include multiple series, allowing for comparison between different data sets or categories within the same plot.

## Features of Line Plots

Line plots come with a range of features that make them effective for data visualization:

- **Trend Analysis**: Easily visualize trends and changes over time or categories.
- **Comparative Analysis**: Compare multiple data series within the same plot for direct comparison.
- **Clear Interpretation**: Line plots are straightforward and easy to understand, even for complex data sets.
- **Customizable**: Tailor the appearance of the plot with various customization options, including line style, markers, and colors.

## Use Cases

Line plots are used across various domains to visualize data:

- **Finance**: Tracking stock prices, revenue, or other financial metrics over time.
- **Science**: Analyzing changes in temperature, pressure, or other continuous variables.
- **Healthcare**: Monitoring patient vital signs or disease progression over time.
- **Business**: Comparing sales trends, customer growth, or other key metrics across periods.

## How to Generate a Line Plot with Cubode-Agent

Generating a line plot with Cubode-Agent is a straightforward process:

1. **Sign In / Login**: Access the Cubode-Agent platform with your credentials.
2. **Upload Your CSV File**: Import the dataset you want to visualize as a line plot.
3. **Click Generate**: Let the AI analyze your data and generate the line plot automatically.
4. **Add New Series**: You can create more than one plot from the same dataset by adding new series, allowing you to compare different columns or data points within the same chart.
5. **Customize**: Use the sidebar to customize your line plot's appearance and settings, such as axis labels, line style, and colors.
6. **Save or Export**: Once satisfied with your plot, you can save or export it for further use.

## Important Features for Proper Operation

When using Cubode-Agent to generate line plots, it's important to pay attention to several key features to ensure the agent functions correctly and produces accurate visualizations.

### 1. Series: Choosing the Column Category and Values

In the **Series** section, always choose the **Column Category** that contains categorical or time-series data. This category is typically used on the x-axis. The **Values** section should hold numerical data, which will be plotted on the y-axis.

#### Example:
If your dataset contains a column called "Date" and another column called "Sales", you could use "Date" as the column category and "Sales" as the values to visualize sales trends over time.

### 2. Aggregation Options

Choosing the right aggregation type is crucial for accurately representing your data in a line plot. Cubode-Agent provides several aggregation options:

- **Sum**: Aggregates the total value for each category.
- **Min**: Displays the minimum value within each category.
- **Max**: Displays the maximum value within each category.
- **Mean**: Represents the average value within each category.
- **Count**: Counts the occurrences of each category.

The appropriate aggregation type depends on the nature of your data and the insights you wish to gain. For example:
- **Sum** is useful when you want to see the total sales over time.
- **Mean** is appropriate when you want to compare average temperatures across different days.

### 3. Customization Options

Cubode-Agent provides a robust set of customization options to tailor your line plots to your specific needs. These options are divided into two main settings menus: the **Main Settings Menu** and the **Series Menu**.

#### Main Settings Menu

The **Main Settings Menu** allows you to customize several critical aspects of your line plot:

1. **Chart Title**: The title of the chart, which gives a clear indication of what the plot represents. This is automatically defined by the AI based on the data and plot type.
2. **Chart Subtitle**: A secondary title that provides additional context or details about the plot. This is also defined by the AI.
3. **X Axis Label**: The label for the x-axis, typically representing the categories or time intervals. Defined by the AI based on the selected column category.
4. **Y Axis Label**: The label for the y-axis, typically representing the values. This label is also defined by the AI according to the selected numerical data and aggregation type.
5. **Legend**: Choose to display or hide the legend, which explains the data represented in the plot, especially useful when multiple series are present.
6. **Data Zoom**: Enable or disable the data zoom feature, which allows users to zoom in on specific sections of the plot for a more detailed view.

#### Series Menu

The **Series Menu** offers additional options to fine-tune the data representation within your line plot:

1. **Series Name**: You can add or change the name of the series. The series name is used to identify different data sets within the plot, which is particularly useful when comparing multiple series.
2. **Column Category and Values**: Although these are initially defined by the AI, you can change the selected column category (categorical or time-series data) and values (numerical data) if needed. This flexibility allows you to adjust the data that the line plot represents.
3. **Aggregation**: As mentioned earlier, you can select or change the type of aggregation (Sum, Min, Max, Mean, Count) applied to the numerical data.
4. **Marker Size**: Adjust the size of the data markers on the line plot. Larger markers can help emphasize data points, while smaller markers are useful for less cluttered visuals.
5. **Line Type**: Choose between a **Smooth** line, which rounds the edges between points for a more fluid look, or a **Normal** line, which connects points with straight segments.
6. **Line Style**: Customize the appearance of the line by selecting from **Solid**, **Dotted**, or **Dashed** styles. The line style can be further customized by selecting the **Line Color**.
7. **Show Area**: Optionally, display the area under the line to highlight the volume or magnitude of data points.
8. **Show Data Labels**: Toggle the display of data labels directly on the plot. This is useful for highlighting specific values directly on the line.
9. **Marker Color Space**: Customize the color of the data markers by using the default color palette or selecting custom colors. This allows for greater differentiation between multiple series in the same plot.

## Conclusion

Line plots are an essential tool for visualizing trends, patterns, and comparisons over time or across categories. With Cubode-Agent, generating and customizing line plots becomes a seamless process, allowing you to create multiple series from the same dataset and tailor the visualization to meet your specific needs. Whether you need to analyze trends in sales data, compare scientific measurements, or track changes in financial metrics, Cubode-Agent provides the flexibility and power to create the perfect line plot for your data analysis tasks.
